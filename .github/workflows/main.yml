Yes, I was able to figure this out today.

First, you need to go through this tutorial on AWS to set up your EC2 server, as well as configure the Application and Deployment Group in CodeDeploy: Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to deploy an application from GitHub

Then, you can use the following workflow in GitHub Actions to deploy your code on push. You essentially use the AWS CLI to create a new deployment. Store the AWS credentials for the CLI in GitHub Secrets.

Here is an example for deploying a Node app:

name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy AWS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]
        app-name: ['ri']
        deployment-group: ['ra']
        repo: ['raghvendran966/sample_node']
        
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Build app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Install AWS CLI 
        run: |
          curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
          unzip awscliv2.zip
          sudo ./aws/install --update
      
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-session-token: ${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
          
      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          aws deploy create-deployment \
          --application-name ${{ matrix.app-name }} \
          --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
          --deployment-group-name ${{ matrix.deployment-group }} \
          --description "GitHub Deployment for the ${{ matrix.app-name }}-${{ github.sha }}" \
          --github-location repository=${{ matrix.repo }},commitId=${{ github.sha }}
